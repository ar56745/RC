temp - humidity, pressure

cloud cover - humidity,precipitation

precipitation - dew point, cloud cover

dew point - humidity, temp, *pressure

wind chill - temp, wind speed, *heat index

humidity - dew point, temp (in paper with light)

humidity - dew point, pressure, temp

wind gust - wind speed, pressure, *wind dir

visibilty - humidity, wind speed, precipitation

wind speed - temp, humidity, pressure

heat index - temp, humidity (both directly proportional)

pressure - temp, humidity, precipitation
